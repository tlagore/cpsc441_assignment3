/**
 * TxQueue Class
 * 
 * TxQueue implements a first-in first-out queue of segments using a circular array.
 * Items are added at the 'tail' of the queue, while items are removed from the 'head' of the queue.
 * The next segment to be removed is at the 'head'.
 * 
 * This is a blocking implementation:
 * The queue has a capacity. A call to add() when the queue is full
 * blocks the calling process until space becomes available by calling remove().
 * A call to remove() when the queue is empty will block the calling process until
 * a segment is added to the queue using add(). 
 *
